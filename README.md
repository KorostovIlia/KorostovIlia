## Why Java?
* Java is a popular programming language that has been around for over 25 years and is still widely used today. Here are some reasons why Java is considered the best programming language:

1. **Easy to learn**: Java shares many similarities with other programming languages like C, C++, and JavaScript, making it easy for programmers with experience in those languages to pick up Java syntax quickly. Java also has a rigid and predictable set of rules that govern code structure, which makes learning easier. Furthermore, there is a strong support network of YouTube videos, websites like StackOverflow, and online forums like CodeRanch to find answers to a multitude of questions.

2. **Rich set of APIs**: Java has a rich set of APIs that make it easy to develop complex applications. Few other programming languages enjoy the same level of tooling support that Java does, which helps cement itself as the best programming language.

3. **Portability**: Java is recognized for its portability across platforms, from mainframe data centers to smartphones. Today there are more than 3 billion devices running applications built with Java. Java is widely used in web and application development as well as big data. Java is also used on the backend of several popular websites, including Google, Amazon, Twitter, and YouTube.

4. **Versatility**: Java is a bit of a jack-of-all-trades when it comes to programming languages. It may not break any performance records, but it can do everything from software engineering to back-end web development, data science, and big data. Furthermore, itâ€™s often used in financial services thanks to its robust security. Java programmers can quickly pick up a new language due to its transferable skills. For that reason, Java can be the perfect first programming language to learn for any code enthusiast. Besides, job demands for Java developers remain high.

5. **First-order Android support**: Android is the world's most popular mobile phone OS, and Java is the de facto programming language for Android application development. This makes Java a popular choice for mobile app development.

In conclusion, Java is a popular programming language that is easy to learn, has a rich set of APIs, is portable, versatile, and has first-order Android support. These features make Java a popular choice for developers and companies alike.
